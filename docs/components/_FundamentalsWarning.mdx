Note that **this tutorial intentionally shows older-style patterns that require more code than the "modern Redux" patterns we teach as the right approach for building apps with Redux today**, in order to explain the principles and concepts behind Redux. It's _not_ meant to be a production-ready project.

See these pages to learn how to use "modern Redux" with Redux Toolkit:

- [**Redux Fundamentals, Part 8: Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit**](../tutorials/fundamentals/part-8-modern-redux.md), which shows how to convert the low-level examples from earlier sections into modern Redux Toolkit equivalents
- [**The "Redux Essentials" tutorial**](../tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts.md), which teaches "how to use Redux, the right way" with Redux Toolkit for real-world apps,
