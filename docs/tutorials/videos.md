For those of you familiar with Redux Hooks, we use those here, but the emphasis is more on how the Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of setting up your redux application including building slices, reducers, selectors and thunks. Everything we do in the course is typed with TypeScript to make your application development process as smooth and powerful as possible.
